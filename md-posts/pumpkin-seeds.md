**Pumpkin seeds**, also known as pepitas, have a rich and diverse culinary history. They are a common ingredient in Mexican cuisine and are enjoyed around the world in various forms. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the fascinating journey of pumpkin seeds through time and cultures.

Pumpkin seeds are not just a seasonal snack in the United States; they are a year-round delight. Just like sunflower seeds, they are commercially produced and distributed as a packaged snack. Pepitas, as they are known in their Spanish name, are typically salted and sometimes spiced after roasting. You can find them not only in Mexico but also in other Latin American countries, the American Southwest, and in specialty and Mexican food stores.

The history of pumpkin seeds dates back thousands of years, with evidence of their domestication stretching from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. This predates the domestication of other crops like maize and common beans in the same region by about 4,000 years. Changes in fruit shape and color suggest intentional breeding of the Cucurbita pepo, the pumpkin's botanical name, occurred no later than 8,000 years ago. The development of agricultural knowledge for crop domestication took place over 5,000 to 6,500 years in Mesoamerica. Squash was the first to be domesticated, followed by maize and beans, forming the Three Sisters agricultural system.

Pumpkin seeds are versatile and find their way into various dishes worldwide. In Mexican cuisine, they are used in mole dishes and are known as pipián. Additionally, there's a traditional Mexican snack known as pepitoría, where pepitas are used in an artisan fashion.

In Greece, lightly roasted, salted, and unhulled pumpkin seeds are popular and are referred to as πασατέμπο, or pasatémbo, derived from the Italian word 'passatempo,' which means 'pastime.'

The culinary journey of pumpkin seeds doesn't stop there. In Central and Eastern Europe, particularly in Styria, the pressed oil of roasted seeds from a specific pumpkin variety, Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo var. 'styriaca,' is a prized ingredient. This unique pumpkin seed oil is used in various dishes and is highly valued.

Furthermore, pumpkin seeds can be transformed into nut butter, offering a delightful and nutritious spread option. Their applications are not limited to food; they can also be used to create a unique alcoholic beverage. Pumpkin seeds can be steeped in neutral alcohol and distilled to produce an eau de vie, a clear fruit brandy.

In the Yucatán region of Mexico, a traditional dish called sikil pak is prepared using pumpkin seeds. This salsa, rich in flavor and cultural significance, adds a unique dimension to the culinary landscape.

The journey of pumpkin seeds, from their ancient domestication to their diverse culinary uses, showcases their enduring popularity and adaptability in various cuisines. Whether as a snack, an ingredient in traditional dishes, or a source of unique oils and spirits, pumpkin seeds continue to leave their mark on global cuisine.
