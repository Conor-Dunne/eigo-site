**Scientists have discovered a new virus in the bodies of four African elephants that died in Rwanda in 2022. This virus likely caused severe pneumonia, ultimately leading to their deaths.**


The virus's impact extends to approximately 1,000 African elephants in Rwanda, Uganda, and Congo. These endangered animals face a real risk of extinction, with only a small population remaining in the wild.


Researchers, led by Dr. Jean Bosco Noheli, a wildlife veterinarian from Gorilla Doctors, studied the deaths of 12 elephants in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. GPS trackers were used to locate the carcasses.


The study revealed that eight of the elephants had pneumonia at the time of their deaths, with four of them carrying the new virus, known as RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This virus, previously found in humans and other animals, is now linked to pneumonia in African elephants.


The social nature of elephants raises concerns about the virus's potential spread within their groups, explaining the high number of deaths. These findings are significant for conservationists working to protect this species.


Further research is needed to understand how this virus might affect other animals, such as chimpanzees and monkeys. Developing interventions, including a potential vaccine, will require extensive research and effort.

In conclusion, this discovery highlights the urgent need for continued study and protective measures for African elephants in the face of this new virus threat.
