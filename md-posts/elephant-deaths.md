**Elephants are facing a new threat. A new virus that can make them very sick has been found in the bodies of four African elephants that died in Rwanda.**

Scientists think this virus was the reason for a pneumonia, or lung infection, that killed the animals in 2022.

The findings are published in the journal Science.

The study might help us understand more about the health of 1,000 African elephants that live in Rwanda, Uganda, and Congo.

This news is very important, because conservationists are working hard to protect these elephants from extinction. They are endangered animals with only a few left in the wild.

Researchers who made the discovery were studying the deaths of 12 elephants - mostly between June and August 2022 in Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda.

Dr Jean Bosco Noheli, a wildlife veterinarian from Gorilla Doctors, explained that the team had to find the bodies using GPS trackers.

Wearing special clothes, in very hot weather, he and his team checked 10 elephants. "They're very big animals," said Dr Noheli. "So it's not easy to get samples from their organs."

The researchers found out that eight of the elephants had pneumonia when they died. And they found a possible cause - a virus called RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) - in four of them. It is a type that has been found before in humans and other animals.

Prof Tony Goldberg from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was part of the team, told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science that cold and rainy weather and lack of food that year could have made the elephants weaker, allowing the virus to infect them more easily.

"[This type of virus] is not very new - it is well-known to exist," said Prof Goldberg. "But it had not been linked to pneumonia and never been found in the African elephants."

The scientist said he thought that the elephants got the virus from humans or other animals that live near them.

"This is not very rare," he said. "We have many germs that do not cause disease - and certainly not death. But if the host defenses are low, that lets the virus spread and in the end, it does not just cause a mild infection like a cold - but causes severe disease."

Elephants are very social animals, so the researchers are worried that they could also give the virus to others, which would explain why so many died.

Laura Rosen from US-based company Transboundary Epidemiology Analytics, said the finding was "very concerning".

"African elephants are an endangered species with only 1,000 remaining in the wild and ongoing losses estimated at 5% every year. Studying the deaths of these elephants is very important to keep this amazing species alive."

Prof Goldberg added that more research was needed to know "how this virus affects other animals like chimpanzees and monkeys".

"Hopefully with more studies, we would be able to find out not only what causes these outbreaks, but also how to stop them - maybe even with a vaccine. But that would need a lot of more work."
