**TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform, is experimenting with a new way to enhance your TikTok experience. They are testing a monthly subscription service that removes ads from your TikTok feed.**

TikTok is currently trying out this new subscription service in a place where people speak English. Unfortunately, they haven't told us exactly where this testing is happening. What we do know is that to enjoy this ad-free experience, you would need to pay $4.99 every month (that's about £4.13).

Usually, when you use TikTok and you're 18 or older, you see ads in between videos. But this new service aims to make those ads disappear if you're willing to subscribe.
